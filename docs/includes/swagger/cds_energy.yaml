            - all energy usage is charged at a single unit rate no matter when it
            is consumed. Multiple unit rates may exist that correspond to varying
            volumes of usage i.e. a ‘block’ or ‘step’ tariff (first 50kWh @ X cents,
            next 50kWh at Y cents etc.</li><li>**SINGLE_RATE_CONT_LOAD** - as above,
            but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage
            from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water
            service, pool pump etc.</li><li>**TIME_OF_USE** - energy usage is charged
            at unit rates that vary dependent on time of day and day of week that
            the energy is consumed</li><li>**TIME_OF_USE_CONT_LOAD** - as above, but
            with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from
            a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service,
            pool pump etc.</li><li>**FLEXIBLE** - energy usage is charged at unit
            rates that vary based on external factors</li><li>**FLEXIBLE_CONT_LOAD**
            - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all
            energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance
            like hot water service, pool pump etc.</li><li>**QUOTA** - all energy
            usage is charged at a single fixed rate, up to a specified usage quota/allowance.
            All excess usage beyond the allowance is then charged at a single unit
            rate (may not be the best way to explain it but it is essentially a ‘subscription’
            or telco style product i.e. $50/month for up to 150kWh included usage</li></ul>
