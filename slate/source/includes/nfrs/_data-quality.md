## Data Quality

If a Data Holder of CDR data is required or authorised under the Consumer Data Rules to disclose product data, the Data Holder **MUST** take reasonable steps to ensure that the product data is, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, accurate, up to date and complete.

Data Holders are required to be able to demonstrate that reasonable steps to maintain data quality of product data are being undertaken.

Note: For the data quality requirements that apply to CDR data for which there are one or more CDR consumers, see Privacy Safeguard 11 (section 56EN of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010). There are requirements in Privacy Safeguard 11 for both Data Holders and Data Recipients. See [Chapter 11 (Privacy Safeguard 11)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/cdr-privacy-safeguard-guidelines/chapter-11-privacy-safeguard-11-quality-of-cdr-data/) of the OAICâ€™s CDR Privacy Safeguard Guidelines for further information.
